- merge all libraries (mkXany)
- retab on many of the sources for better standardization
- verify that packaging does not modify uid.gid of system directories
- Ensure /etc, /opt and /dev are uid.gid root.system when they are part
    part of the package contents.

## read the git log for the changes


buildaix 2.1.2.1: 2019-12-17
 * when subdir =="static" go one level deeper for the product and set PROGRAM to static

buildaix 2.1.2.0:
 * find git/product-version as source

buildaix 2.1.1.0: 2017-04-12
 * revert change to prefix - until it is integrated into the mkinstallp program
 ** and the stuff added to deal with creating links (and removing them)
 ** to /opt/bin, /opt/lib, etc..

buildaix 2.1.0.0: 2017-02-14
 * change release number - to parallel the new default prefix /opt/${PROGRAM}
 * modify prefix so that it is /opt/${PROGRAM} to create a unique space

buildaix 2.0.21.0 and 2.0.22.0: 2017-02-14
 * add support for "static" builds
 * add 'adt' for /(opt|usr)/(include|lib)/*.[ha] - so not /opt/lib/{package}*/
 * add two scripts to extract X32 and X64 builds - as precusor to mkXany
 ** or manual changes to default build process

buildaix 2.0.20.0: 2018-01-13
 * improve progress feedback

buildaix 2.0.19.0: 2017-12-05
 * source control now in git
 * drop, or put behind $VERBOSE - most of the feedback currently output (mkinstallp.ksh)
 * export PRODUCT and FILESET so they get picked up by aixinfo and mkinstallp

buildaix 2.0.18.0: 2017-10-05
 * add mkXany (and cplib.ksh) to automate making dual (32- and 64-bit) packages
 * work on mkinstallp.ksh - to support more of what makebff.pl can handle (e.g., .cfgfiles)
 ** note: requires a second call to makebff.pl when 'special' stuff is needed.
 ** what is 'special' may depend on AIX level (AIX 6+ mkinstallp does more that AIX5)
 * This includes moving some core around - hopefully to improve legibility
 * auto_merge and hold_new fail at post_i processing, better before .config processing
 * because the .inventory processing fails (mkinstallp makes a default .inventory)
 * * user_merge is less pretty because it gives a lengthy message at the end.
 * * other: works - in that it gets the MIGSAVE directory defined and copies an original
 * * file, but - it may be simplier to write a ._pre_i and .unpre_i to copy files
 * * to $TMPDIR - so that, during successful install/upgrade .config can use the
 * * files in $TMPDIR

buildaix 2.0.17.0: 2017-09-21
 * added config and unconfig scripts to copy/remove include files stored in 
   /opt/buildaix/include (e.g., zlib.h et al) to /usr/include

buildaix 2.0.16.0: 2017-09-08
 * added an extra character that cannot (easily) be in filename in the inventory

buildaix 2.0.15.0: 2017-06-15
 * fixed an error when using -V and -D - the copy was correct,
   but it could not find the .bff file generated
 * added a flag to number "b" beta packages automatically
   creating a new FIX number based on number after the 'b'

buildaix 2.0.14.0: 2017-02-08
 * fixed bug with vrmf not properly reset when zero length

buildaix 2.0.13.0: 2017-02-08
 * fix - add .config, .pre_i, etc. for other sections!
 * edited CHANGELOG - to shorten long description lines
 * fix bug - when aixtools.zlib was installed bzlib.h was not found.
   Check for all alturnates provided by /opt/buildaix/include
 * add support for supercedes config file - that makebff.pl supports,
   but /usr/sbin/mkinstallp does not

buildaix 2.0.12.0: 2016-11-02
 * fix -D output so that it can be piped into ksh for execution
 * use full pathname for grep and egrep to prevent syntax issues when GNU grep
   is also installed
 * fix aixinfo so that "prj" is never a PRODUCT name
 * personal change for me - when subdir is prj - ignore it - asif == "aixtools"
 * change default machine to pwr5 for xlc
 * default -O setting is now -O3 - will add flag tbd to see optimize level
 * have seperate special CFLAGS by compiler, rather than only xlc
   (that breaks gcc)

buildaix 2.0.11.0: 2016-08-24
 * removed remaining comments for the aborted 64-bit packaging
   - finishing the purge of version 2.0.8.0
 * add a call to ./buildaix/bin/prep_install.ksh, if exists,
   for project processing before mkinstallp packaging begins
 * add -qarch=pwr4 and -qmaxmem=-1 to CFLAGS (assumes xlc as compiler!)
 * fixed bug with -p OPTARG processing
 * changed -e to not depend on ${prefix},
   i.e., not always be a subdir of ${prefix}
 * Modify Fileset Description: to always include ${PRODUCT} ${FILESET}
 * make sure opt/lib/charset.alias has a unique name,
   TBD .post_i processing to set symbolic link

buildaix 2.0.10.1: 2016-06-06
 * make sure .I files are world-readable regadless of umask setting
 * restore a lost addition - namely to add a requisites line such as:
   ">0 { *prereq idsldap.clt32bit62.rte 6.2.0.0 *prereq idsldap.clt32bit63.rte 6.3.0.0 }"
   i.e., to add a group requisite specification of needing one or more
   of a group, e.g., >0 is at least 1 of { ... }

buildaix 2.0.10.0: 2016-05-24
 * corrected a typo in buildaix.ksh - so TARGETDIR is provided everywhere
   in option -D output
 * improved interaction between buildaix and mkinstallp when using buildaix -D

buildaix 2.0.9.0: 2016-04-11
 * corrected a bug where the TARGETDIR was not getting updated soon enough
   (-V argument processing)

buildaix 2.0.8.0: starting 2016-03-04
 * remove 64-bit 'mangling' of the filesets packaging - want autotools
   to modify dirnames, not buildaix scripts

buildaix 2.0.7.0: starting 2016-03-02
 * add ' ' (space) as character to catch (buildaix:filename_cleanup())
 * use ':' to seperate old:new name fo file (for later function to move
   files to original name)
 * TODO : put moved in lpp:root component as a file
 * remove ${AIXVER} from .I filename - might be needed in special cases!
   but off for now

buildaix 2.0.6.0: starting 2016-02-04
 * default uid:gid is bin:bin rather than root:system
 * finish initial proposal for argument -D|c prepare a proposal for packaging
   a directory

buildaix 2.0.5.0: 2016-01-19
 * look in ../src/${dirname} to make use of autotools ability to seperate
   source and build directories
 * make the .rte comment more human readable - was cryptic builddate numbers
 * change universale pages to universal files for .share description

buildaix 2.0.4.0: 2015-11-06
 * correct type where the requisites file got wiped with application
   specifics (mkinstallp.ksh)
 * initial support for discovery of and modifications for 64-bit support
   (not finished yet)

   changes lpp string when either $PRODUCT==$PROGRAM || $PRODUCT==$FILESET
 * moved test for bos.adt.insttools to mkinstallp.ksh (from buildaix.ksh)
 * added processing for requisites (stanzas specified in buildaix/requisites)
 * fixed bug so that flags such as -V are processed properly
 * restored man pages extension to include default language - so .man becomes
   .man.en_US again
 * add *instreq for man pages to keep superflous installation of man pages
   from occuring

   in PROJECT NAME

   to prevent loading backwards

buildaix 1.0.6.0: 29 October 2013

  * started documentation for buildaix (simple man page for buildaix)

    e.g. gettext-0.18.1.1
